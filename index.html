  <h2>Telepathy</h2>
  <p>Anya is capable of reading the minds of other people and animals, her ability depicted as small sparks around her head. 
    However, she is sensitive to being in large crowds as she becomes overwhelmed and dizzy by too many thoughts, to the point of getting a nosebleed. 
    Anya finds it difficult to understand complicated minds, such as Loid's.
  </p>
  <h2>Personality</h2>
  <p>
    As a young child, Anya is very impressionable towards the people around her. 
    For instance, reading Loid's mind and acting in ways he found very odd and learning how to punch from Yor. 
    Given her telepathic ability ostracizing her from people and her many foster homes, she instantly took to "Twilight" for being a real spy. 
    Since being adopted, she wanted to go wherever Loid was going in hopes of seeing the spy stuff she always sees on TV.
